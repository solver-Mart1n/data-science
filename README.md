| Task | Questions Answered After Performing the Task | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Business Understanding | What is the problem that you are trying to solve? | |
| Analytic Approach | How can you use data to answer the business question? | |
| Data Requirements | What data do you need to answer the question? | [DS0103EN-Review-From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Review-From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb) |
| Data Collection | Where is the data sourced from, and how will you receive the data? | [DS0103EN-Review-From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Review-From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb) |
| Data Understanding | Does the data you collected represent the problem to be solved? | [DS0103EN-Exercise-From-U-to-P.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Exercise-From-U-to-P.ipynb) |
| Data Preparation | What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data? | [DS0103EN-Exercise-From-U-to-P.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Exercise-From-U-to-P.ipynb) |
| Modeling | When you apply data visualizations, do you see answers that address the business problem? | [DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb) |
| Evaluation | Does the data model answer the intial business question, or must you adjust the data? | [DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb) |
| Deployment | Can you put the model into practice? | |
| Feedback | Can you get constructive feedback from the data and the stakeholder to answer the business question? | |

## Python for Data Science: *([data-science/reference/ibm_ds/python](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/tree/main/reference/ibm_ds/language/python))*

## Python for Data Science Project: *([Final Assignment-Jupyter Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/language/python/final_project/answers/Final%20Assignment%20-%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb))*
The course 5 project from the IBM Data Science Certificate Program exposes the learner to building a  Python Notebook that exhibits knowledge and exemplifies the following ***Web Scraping*** and ***Dashboarding*** skills:	
|claim|description|
|---|---|
| claim 1	| display tables, such as historical stock data of a publicly traded company, from a website, such as Yahoo Finance, using the yfinance library visible from Question 1, Question 3; |
| claim 2	| display tables, such as historical revenue data of a publicly traded company, from a website, such as Yahoo Finance, using the bs4 and pandas library, read_html() visible from Question 2, Question 4; and |
| claim 3	| plot sequence or time series data, such as historical stock and revenue data of a publicly traded company, from a data frame using the pandas library and user-defined method, make_graph() visible from Question 5, Question 6. |
| claim 4 |  To see claims 1 to 3 in action, you may run the python notebook using this [Google Colab Cloud Environment](https://colab.research.google.com/github/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/solver-Mart1n-c05w1p2-FinalProject/reference/ibm_ds/language/python/final_project/answers/Final%20Assignment%20-%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb) free of charge.|
