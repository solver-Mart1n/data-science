| Task | Questions Answered After Performing the Task | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Business Understanding | What is the problem that you are trying to solve? | |
| Analytic Approach | How can you use data to answer the business question? | |
| Data Requirements | What data do you need to answer the question? | [DS0103EN-Review-From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Review-From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb) |
| Data Collection | Where is the data sourced from, and how will you receive the data? | [DS0103EN-Review-From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Review-From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb) |
| Data Understanding | Does the data you collected represent the problem to be solved? | [DS0103EN-Exercise-From-U-to-P.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Exercise-From-U-to-P.ipynb) |
| Data Preparation | What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data? | [DS0103EN-Exercise-From-U-to-P.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Exercise-From-U-to-P.ipynb) |
| Modeling | When you apply data visualizations, do you see answers that address the business problem? | [DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb) |
| Evaluation | Does the data model answer the intial business question, or must you adjust the data? | [DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/reference/ibm_ds/DS0103EN-Exercise-From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb) |
| Deployment | Can you put the model into practice? | |
| Feedback | Can you get constructive feedback from the data and the stakeholder to answer the business question? | |
