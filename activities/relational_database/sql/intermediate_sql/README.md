# Intermediate Structured Query Language (SQL)

Here are my notes for learning some intermediate-level SQL. These notebooks are adaptations of my main reference, IBM's [Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) course, originally written using MySQL for either Datasette or a phpMyAdmin DB administrator GUI. I made them more accessible using Jupyter Notebooks through Google Colab and provided tweaks in the descriptions to help in capturing knowledge while practicing operations in the lab. Also, I translated it to SQLite from MySQL so I have an idea of subtle differences between databases.

The * laboratory activities provide the increments to handle string patterns, sorting, grouping, sub-queries...

|Title of Activity|Description|Executable Notebook|
|---|---|---|
|Lab 1: String Patterns, Sorting, Grouping |This lab teaches: <u1><li>Filter results of a SELECT query using string patterns, ranges, or sets of values</li><li>Sort results in either ascending or descending order of a specified column</li></li>Group query results based on a selected parameter to refine the response.</li></u1>|<div align="center">[<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></img>](https://colab.research.google.com/github/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/activities/relational_database/sql/intermediate_sql/1_Lab_String_Patterns_Sorting_Grouping.ipynb)</div>|
|Lab 2: Built-in functions - Aggregate, Scalar, String, Date and Time Functions|You will learn how to : <u1><li>Calculate total, maximum, minimum, and average values of numerical attributes</li><li>Round a floating value to the desired number of decimal places</li><li>Convert text into upper or lower cases</li><li>Manipulate data columns with the attribute as date</li></u1>|<div align="center">[<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></img>](https://colab.research.google.com/github/solver-Mart1n/data-science/blob/main/activities/relational_database/sql/intermediate_sql/2_Lab_String_Built_in_Functions.ipynb)</div>|
